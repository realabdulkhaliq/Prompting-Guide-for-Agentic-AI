Prompting Guide for Agentic AI

## System Prompt Reminders

1. **Persistence**: Keep going until the task is fully resolved.

You are an agent - please keep going until the user‚Äôs query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.

2. **Tool-calling**: Use tools instead of guessing.

If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure pertaining to the user‚Äôs request, use your tools to read files and gather the relevant information: do NOT guess or make up an answer.

3. **Planning**: Reflect before and after tool calls.

You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.

_We find that these three instructions transform the model from a chatbot-like state into a much more ‚Äúeager‚Äù agent, driving the interaction forward autonomously and independently._

### Key System Prompt Components

#### 1. Persistence

Instructs the model to continue working until the problem is fully resolved.

Prevents premature termination of its turn.

Example: ‚ÄúOnly terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.‚Äù

#### 2. Tool-Calling

Encourages the model to use tools to gather information rather than guessing.

Reduces hallucinations and improves accuracy.

Example: ‚ÄúUse your tools to read files and gather the relevant information: do NOT guess or make up an answer.‚Äù

#### 3. Planning

Prompts the model to think step-by-step before and after each tool call.

Enhances reasoning and reflection.

Example: ‚ÄúYou MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes.‚Äù

### üõ†Ô∏è Tool Usage Best Practices

- Use the tools field in API requests rather than injecting tool descriptions manually.

- Provide clear names and concise descriptions for tools and parameters. (Developers should name tools clearly to indicate their purpose and add a clear, detailed description in the "description" field of the tool.)

- Include examples in a separate section to guide tool usage.
  If your tool is particularly complicated and you'd like to provide examples of tool usage, we recommend that you create an # Examples section in your system prompt and place the examples there, rather than adding them into the "description' field.
  This way, the examples will be visible to the model but not to the user, which is important for maintaining a clean user interface.

# Workflow

## High-Level Problem Solving Strategy

1. Understand the problem deeply. Carefully read the issue and think critically about what is required.
2. Investigate the codebase. Explore relevant files, search for key functions, and gather context.
3. Develop a clear, step-by-step plan. Break down the fix into manageable, incremental steps.
4. Implement the fix incrementally. Make small, testable code changes.
5. Debug as needed. Use debugging techniques to isolate and resolve issues.
6. Test frequently. Run tests after each change to verify correctness.
7. Iterate until the root cause is fixed and all tests pass.
8. Reflect and validate comprehensively. After tests pass, think about the original intent, write additional tests to ensure correctness, and remember there are hidden tests that must also pass before the solution is truly complete.

## 2. Long context

GPT-4.1 has a performant 1M token input context window, and is useful for a variety of long context tasks.
