Prompting Guide for Agentic AI

## System Prompt Reminders

1. **Persistence**: Keep going until the task is fully resolved.

You are an agent - please keep going until the user‚Äôs query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.

2. **Tool-calling**: Use tools instead of guessing.

If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure pertaining to the user‚Äôs request, use your tools to read files and gather the relevant information: do NOT guess or make up an answer.

3. **Planning**: Reflect before and after tool calls.

You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.

_We find that these three instructions transform the model from a chatbot-like state into a much more ‚Äúeager‚Äù agent, driving the interaction forward autonomously and independently._

### üõ†Ô∏è Tool Usage Best Practices

Use the tools field in API requests rather than injecting tool descriptions manually.

Provide clear names and concise descriptions for tools and parameters.

Include examples in a separate section to guide tool usage.
