Prompt 1
Create a 1/7 scale commercialized figurine of the characters in the picture, in a realistic style, in a real environment. The figurine is placed on a computer desk. The figurine has a round transparent acrylic base, with no text on the base. The content on the computer screen is the ZBrush modeling process of this figurine. Next to the computer screen is a BANDAI-style toy packaging box printed with the original artwork. The packaging features two-dimensional flat illustrations.
The figurine is highly detailed, capturing the intricate features of the characters, including their clothing, facial expressions, and accessories. The colors are vibrant and true to the original design, with careful attention to shading and highlights to enhance the realism. The acrylic base is polished and clear, providing a sturdy support for the figurine while allowing light to pass through, creating a visually appealing effect.
