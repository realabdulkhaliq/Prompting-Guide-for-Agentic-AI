# GPT-5 prompting guide

## Agentic workflow predictability

We trained GPT-5 with developers in mind: weâ€™ve focused on improving tool calling, instruction following, and long-context understanding to serve as the best foundation model for agentic applications.

_If adopting GPT-5 for agentic and tool calling flows, we recommend upgrading to the Responses API, where reasoning is persisted between tool calls, leading to more efficient and intelligent outputs._

### Prompting for less eagerness

- Switch to a lower reasoning_effort. This reduces exploration depth but improves efficiency and latency. Many workflows can be accomplished with consistent results at medium or even low reasoning_effort.
